# ThetagangWheel - Options Screening Tool

A Python-based tool that screens cash-secured put options based on sentiment analysis of r/thetagang posts.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

**FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

- This tool is for educational and research purposes only
- NOT financial advice or trading recommendations
- Yahoo Finance data is delayed and unofficial - use for screening only
- Always conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions
- Options trading involves significant risk and may not be suitable for all investors
- Past performance does not guarantee future results

## Overview

ThetagangWheel analyzes posts from r/thetagang to:

1. **Ingest** top Reddit posts using the free Reddit API
2. **Classify** post sentiment as positive/negative/unclear using VADER sentiment analysis
3. **Extract** stock tickers from posts and validate against official NASDAQ symbol masters
4. **Screen** cash-secured put options for tickers with positive sentiment
5. **Rank** options by weekly yield with safety guardrails (open interest, bid-ask spread, earnings proximity)
6. **Output** results as sorted tables and exportable JSON/CSV files

## Features

- **Free Tier Stack**: Uses only free APIs and data sources
- **Sentiment Analysis**: NLTK VADER + custom rules for options-specific terminology
- **Symbol Validation**: Daily refresh of official NASDAQ/NYSE symbol masters
- **Options Screening**: Focuses on Friday expiration cash-secured puts for $10k accounts
- **Safety Guardrails**: Filters for minimum open interest, reasonable spreads, earnings blackouts
- **Market Hours Aware**: Handles market holidays and post-market expiry shifts
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Console tables, JSON, and CSV export
